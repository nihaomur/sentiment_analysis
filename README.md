# Sentiment Analysis
In this repository, I utilize various methods such as tokenizer and TF-IDF to preprocess text data, followed by employing different techniques to perform sentiment label classification.

## [TF-IDF](tfidf_sentiment_calsify.ipynb)
After applying TF-IDF processing to movie reviews, a linear logistic regression and a fully connected MLP are employed for classification.

## [Tokenizer](tokenizer_sentiment_classify.ipynb)
For Twitter comments, tokenization is performed, and an MLP model is constructed using embedding layers and LSTM, followed by analysis.
